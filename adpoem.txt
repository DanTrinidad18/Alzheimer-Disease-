Do not ask me to remember
Don´t try to make me understan
Let me rest and know you´re with me
Kiss my cheek and hold my hand
I´m confused beyond your concept,
I am sad, and sick and lost.
All I know is that I need you
To be with me at all cost.
Do not lose your patience with me,
Do not scold or curse or cry.
I can´t help the way I´m acting,
Can´t be different through I try.
